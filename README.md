I tried to do some kind of Web Scraping with Java.
It is the same project with master branch but at this specific project I tried to get a repository link from user.
And get the this github repository link's contributers and pick top 5 of them. My goal is use the main "search github accounts by name" method and display the that 5 users informations on the screen.
I use Jsoup at this project.
That project is not complete it is still under construct.
